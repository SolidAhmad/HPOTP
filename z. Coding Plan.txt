Phase 1: 

1- Attempt to Replicate SDDP on a the Linear Policy Graph with noise                  (Done)
2- Attempt to Replicate SDDP a Markovian Policy Graph with noise                      (Done)
3- Attempt to Replicate SDDP on a Markovian Policy Graph without noise                (Done)
4- Attempt to Generalize the algorithm for step number 3                              (Done) 


Phase 2: 

5- Without generalization, try to implement the algorithm on a problem with a binary+continous state variables, make it a simple, 3 stage, 5 node, 3 noise, problem 
with little to no indecies (3bus, 1 time period, no ramp etc). Maybe replicate yet another example to see. After 

5 - Try the generalization on the Hydro Thermal Example 


5- Replicate a very simple problem with minimal data and structure with binary and continous state and local variables  (simple GTEP maybe). 
6- Generalize the Code above to solve the same problem (Making generalized code for a problem with and without noise). For this code, you can attempt it on older problems if you are not successful here. 
7- Recreate and solve the actual paper 2 model on python on the small test case
8- Once all of that is done, I can then try step by step different parallel algorithms on any of the small problems that contain both long and short term uncertainity. 
9- Finally I can go ahead and attempt that on my large scale model from paper 2 and see if it is achievable. 
10- Once all of that is done, I can then Experiment and Look into different types of cuts to make, and also different convergence Criteria. And be fully aware of the state of the art of the algorithm. 

11- Start looking into different algorithms and MSSP solution methods for implementation.
